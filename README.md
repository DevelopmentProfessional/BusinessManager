Page laytout and formatting: 
	For mobvile devices. there is a hanging peiece, is there such a functiuon to hide that at the top of the screen on mobile devices? for instance. on the s24 brwoser. It shows the home icon, the address bar, the add new tab button, the tabs,m and the op[tiopns at the top. i woud lklike that to be hidden or somthing and perhaps add a button to toggle it back on if needed. 

employeee : 
 	Add to the database for the employee table a "supervisor" column
	When selecting to edit the meployee. The modal should have some tabs on it, each tab can be a unique component. (Details, benefits, permissions, Performance) 
		on the details component have thier personal details as well as thier supervisor and direct reports, thier IOD number and other infomration like hire date and location. 
		on the benefits component have all the benefits and deductions like thier pay, insurnace, vacation, and other like information 
		on the permissions page should be specific to granting/denying access to pages
		Performance page needs log of reviews, goals, feedbacks, completed and pending tasks stats. 
Sales :
	on the customer search, add an "+" button to create a new client. opens the new client modal 
	on the cart componenet6. Add the cancel button to the bottom of the modqal. Also, the Add to cart button should not be there since there is alreadyt a quantit.y but whgat should be there is the amount already in the cart. 
	For the fotter of dthe sales page. ity should be the Search Bar. then each of the buttons should be cirtcles. Instead of making the filter for the AlL, Services, Products into three. Put it into two checkboxes where selecting one or the other just adds or remo9ves the products visibility or activates the same mechnisims that already exissts. But instead of three buttons, it would jsut the be the services and products. essentially, it should be (Service)(product)(cart).
	Whgen selecting the item on the sales page with the detqawwiled view. there needs to be an exit button 
	The sales history can go in a modal, and instead of at the top where it opens like a dropdown, it can be a button to the left of the cart button that is seleceted, that button should be the same size as the cart button.  
 	Change the services and products toggle buttons to just icons qand make them the same size as the cart button. 
	
components:
	all the buttons should be on the bottom left within the footer section
	the width should be based on the length of the text within it, no col spacing 

Schedule: 
	The appointments that span over cells need to span to thier actau length, they all seem to take up an hour chunk of time currently. They need to be the side of thier actrual time they take up. 
	The week page on the mobiole phbone is too long and requires scrolling. The calendar in the middle can scroll which is fine, so the calendar in the middle needs a container in which it can be scvrolled, but the footer and header should be at the top and bottom and the user shouldnt need to scroll to get to them. 


Profile: 
	float the cards to the bottom of the page. 
	add a collapse/expand button to the top right of each of the cards on the profile page and when selected it woiuld compact that card and then in the compa=ted veriosn of it would show the header of that card, but when the carsdx is expand3e4d it does not show the header of it.
	add profile picture option to the profile page. The employee profiel in the databvase would need to be able to save a picutre blob in the database for this. update the database to accomodate this feature. 
	Add a notification toggle on the settings section, iut should be like an accordion within it, but the accordiuon doesnt span the full width instead it should go to somthing like a card so if its a card 
	the add to home scree nbutton should be like a house icon, and it shoulnt have words
	the logout button should just be 
	

Reports: 
	float the reports to the bottom of the page. 
	 
Settings: 
	General sdettings : For the log, make there also be an image upload that would save to the branding settings in the database. 
	The changed settingfs for the theme should update on all interface buttons so all interface compoenents and icons need to adhere to the theme standards. 
		
Inventory: 
	Make the middle scrollable element on the ninventory page 100% vertical height minus the height of the Inventory header and the Filter foioters height so that there is no overflow when scro9llingall the way to the top or bottom of the screen on mobile devices.
